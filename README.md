- 🏳️‍⚧️ Hi, I’m Sophia Yu, a 20-year-old living in the vibrant heart of Los Angeles, California. I’m an American-born Chinese transgender woman (MtF), proud of my journey and the strength it’s given me.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, gaming, and exploring LA’s diverse culture—from dim sum brunches to coastal sunsets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development and brushing up on my Mandarin to connect more with my heritage.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that promote inclusivity, especially for the LGBTQ+ community, and open-source tools that make a difference.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 📚 I also help maintain the "多元性别图书馆" (Diverse Gender Library), a resource for education and support on gender diversity.
